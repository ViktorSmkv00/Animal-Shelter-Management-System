# Animal-Shelter-Management-System
 This project is an Animal Shelter Management System designed to facilitate the management of animal adoption and care processes. Built using Java and Spring Boot, it provides a RESTful API  that enables users to perform various operations related to animals in the shelter.

# Features:
 Animal Registration: Allows the addition of new animals into the shelter database with relevant details such as type, name, and date of arrival.
 
 Animal Retrieval: Users can retrieve information about all animals or filter them by type.
 
 Animal Updates: Supports updating existing animal records with new information.
 
 Animal Deletion: Enables the removal of animals from the shelter database when necessary.
 
 Database Integration: Utilizes a relational database (MySQL) for persistent storage, ensuring data integrity and easy retrieval.

# Technology Stack:

 Backend: Java, Spring Boot
 
 Database: MySQL
 
 Dependencies: Spring Data JPA, Hibernate for ORM, Validation, and RESTful API support.

# Purpose:

The system aims to streamline the management of animal data, improve the adoption process, and enhance the overall operational efficiency of animal shelters. By providing a user-friendly API, it enables developers to build applications that can interact with the animal shelter data easily.
